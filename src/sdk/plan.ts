  /**
   * Retrieve a plan
   *
   * @remarks
   * This endpoint is used to fetch [plan](../reference/Orb-API.json/components/schemas/Plan) details given a plan identifier. It returns information about the prices included in the plan and their configuration, as well as the product that the plan is attached to.
   *
   * ## Serialized prices
   * Orb supports a few different pricing models out of the box. Each of these models is serialized differently in a given [Price](../reference/Orb-API.json/components/schemas/Price) object. The `model_type` field determines the key for the configuration object that is present. A detailed explanation of price types can be found in the [Price schema](../reference/Orb-API.json/components/schemas/Price).
   *
   * ## Phases
   * Orb supports plan phases, also known as contract ramps. For plans with phases, the serialized prices refer to all prices across all phases.
